# Loan Risk Prediction Analysis üè¶üìä

## Project Overview

This data science project focuses on predicting loan risk using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various demographic and financial features, we develop a predictive model to assess the likelihood of loan default.

## Key Features

- **Data Exploration**: Comprehensive analysis of loan dataset
- **Preprocessing**: Advanced data cleaning and feature encoding
- **Visualization**: Insightful graphs and correlation analysis
- **Machine Learning**: Random Forest Classifier for risk prediction

## Technical Stack

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## Project Workflow

1. Data Loading
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Data Preprocessing
4. Feature Engineering
5. Model Training
6. Performance Evaluation

## Key Insights

- Visualize loan risk distribution
- Understand feature importance
- Predict loan default probability
